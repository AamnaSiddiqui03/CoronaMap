# CoronaMap

The Corona Map is an interactive map that displays the distribution of COVID-19 cases in different regions or areas. It utilizes the map visualization capabilities provided by Mapbox to represent the severity of the outbreak in a visually intuitive manner.

The map employs a color-coding scheme to indicate the concentration of cases in specific locations. Areas with a higher number of COVID-19 cases are represented by a brighter shade of red, while regions with fewer cases are displayed in a darker hue. This color gradient allows users to quickly assess the severity of the outbreak in different areas at a glance.

By using Mapbox, I have created a website that incorporates this Corona Map. Users can access the map through the website and interact with it, exploring different regions, zooming in and out, and gathering information about COVID-19 cases in specific locations. The interactive nature of the map enhances the user experience and provides a dynamic way to stay informed about the spread of the virus.

Overall, the Corona Map serves as a powerful tool for visualizing the impact of COVID-19 and understanding the geographical distribution of cases.
